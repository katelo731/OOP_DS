# Red_Black_Tree

### Spec :

***using the STL library is not allowed.***

    In this project, you have to implement a red black tree (class) to store the patients' data in a hospital. 
    As you get from the previous homework, 
    each row indicates the index (key), gender, height, and weight of a patient. 
    The goal is to retrieve data from the tree efficiently. 
    You can start your program by imitating the form in the previous homework.
    
**update :**

    The goal is to generate test data for HW4. 
    Since the key generated by a random function can be identical to a previously generated key, 
    in the implementation, you have to check whether this situation occurs. 
    In other words, all previoulsy keys are stored in an RB tree, so as to query a key efficiently. 
    In this homework, you can define your own RBtree.h without any limitation. 
    But you cannot change the codes in the main.cpp.
