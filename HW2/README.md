# Matrix_Calculations

### Spec :

    In this homework, your goal is to implement a 3x3 matrix class that enables common matrix operators 
    such as add, minus, multiply, divide, inverse, and determinant (all as you learned in linear algebra course). 
    Since a 3x3 matrix is composed of three 3x1 vectors,
    we ask you to implement a 3x1 vector class first, 
    and then utilize this class to implement the matrix class. 

### Introduction :

    In this homework,we need to implement the functions in header files given from TA,
    such as :
    
   ##### (1) in vector3.h :
    
    constructors of the 3*1 vector,
    definitions of the operands using in the calculation,
    functions which could return the length of the vector,
    print functions which could print the vector.
    
   ##### (2) in matrix33.h :
   
    the header file's functions are almost as same as the vector3.h,
    but I compose the matrix of 3 vectors to do the calculations.
    and add some new functions here :
    
    the function used to construct the invert matrix,
    the function used to construct a identity matrix,
    the function used to calculate the determinant of the matrix.
