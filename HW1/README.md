# Calendar_Browser

### Spec :

    In this homework, your goal is to implement a Date class that allows moving forward and backward of a date. 
    For example, given a date, Jan. 13, 2014, what is the date 50 days after it? 
    You also have to show what day is a date (such as Tuesday or Friday),
    and print the whole month of a date on the screen. 
    To facilitate grading, a header file declaring the class and a sample main function are attached. 
    You have to make sure that your implementation can run smoothly and correctly.

### Introduction :

    In this homework,we need to implement the functions in header file given from TA,
    such as :
    
    the get-funtions (ex.int getDay();) which returns the day/month/year in the Date class,
    the set-funtions (ex.void setDay(int day);) which updates the day/month/year in the Date class,
  
    the functions (ex.Date DateAfter(int days);) which can return the day after/before a given date,
    the function (string dayOfWeek();) which return the day of a date,
    the function (int numberOfDays();) which return the the number of days in current month,
    the print function (ex.void printMonthCalendar();) which print the calender of the current month.
    the function (ex.int weekofthefirstday();) which return the first day of the current month's date.
